# The UMASK is set by the file "initramfs-tools-conf" (which is copied
# to /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf.d/mandos-conf on installation)
# since there, as described therein, is the proper place to do that.
# However, it is possible for other packages to override the UMASK in
# any file in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf-hooks.d.  Therefore,
# this file ("initramfs-tools-conf-hook") will be installed as
# "zz-mandos" in that directory to make sure UMASK is set correctly.

# For more information on the effects of setting UMASK, see the
# aforementioned /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf.d/mandos-conf file.
