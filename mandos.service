[Unit]
Description=Server of encrypted passwords to Mandos clients
Documentation=man:intro(8mandos) man:mandos(8)

[Service]
Type=simple
## Type=dbus is not appropriate, because Mandos also needs to announce
## its ZeroConf service and be reachable on the network.
#Type=dbus
## Can't set the D-Bus name since we aren't Type=dbus
#BusName=se.recompile.Mandos
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mandos --foreground
Restart=always
KillMode=mixed
## Using socket activation won't work either, because systemd always
## does bind() on the socket, and also won't announce the ZeroConf
## service.
#ExecStart=/usr/sbin/mandos --foreground --socket=0
#StandardInput=socket
