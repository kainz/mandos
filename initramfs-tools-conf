# Since the initramfs image will contain key files, we need to
# restrict permissions on it by setting UMASK here.
# 
# The proper place to set UMASK is (according to
# /etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook), in
# /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf, which we shouldn't edit.  The
# corresponding directory for drop-in files from packages is
# /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf.d, and this file will be installed
# there as "mandos-conf".
# 
# This setting of UMASK will have unfortunate unintended side effects
# on the files *inside* the initramfs, but these are later fixed by
# "initramfs-tools-hook", installed as
# "/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/mandos".
