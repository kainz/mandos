		    Mandos Server D-Bus Interface

This file documents the D-Bus interface to the Mandos server.

* Bus: System bus
  Bus name: "se.bsnet.fukt.Mandos"


* Object Paths:
  
  | Path                  | Object            |
  |-----------------------+-------------------|
  | "/"                   | The Mandos Server |
  | "/clients/CLIENTNAME" | Mandos Client     |

  
* Mandos Server Interface:
  Interface name: "se.bsnet.fukt.Mandos"
  
** Methods:
*** GetAllClients() → (ao: Clients)
    Returns an array of all client D-Bus object paths
   
*** GetAllClientsWithProperties() → (a{oa{sv}}: ClientProperties)
    Returns an array of all clients and all their properties
   
*** RemoveClient(o: ObjectPath) → nothing
    Removes a client
   
** Signals:
*** ClientAdded(o: ObjectPath)
    A new client was added.
   
*** ClientNotFound(s: Fingerprint, s: Address)
    A client connected from Address using Fingerprint, but was
    rejected because it was not found in the server.  The fingerprint
    is represented as a string of hexadecimal digits.  The address is
    an IPv4 or IPv6 address in its normal string format.
   
*** ClientRemoved(o: ObjectPath, s: Name)
    A client named Name on ObjectPath was removed.


* Mandos Client Interface:
  Interface name: "se.bsnet.fukt.Mandos.Client"
  
** Methods
*** Approve(b: Approve) → nothing
    Approve or deny a connected client waiting for approval.  If
    denied, a client will not be sent its secret.
    
*** CheckedOK() → nothing
    Assert that this client has been checked and found to be alive.
    This will restart the timeout before disabling this client.  See
    also the "LastCheckedOK" property.
    
*** Disable() → nothing
    Disable this client.  See also the "Enabled" property.
    
*** Enable() → nothing
    Enable this client.  See also the "Enabled" property.
    
*** StartChecker() → nothing
    Start a new checker for this client, if none is currently
    running.  See also the "CheckerRunning" property.
    
*** StopChecker() → nothing
    Abort a running checker process for this client, if any.  See also
    the "CheckerRunning" property.

** Properties
   
   Note: Many of these properties directly correspond to a setting in
   "clients.conf", in which case they are fully documented in
   mandos-clients.conf(5).
   
   | Name                    | Type | Access     | clients.conf        |

   | ApprovalPending (b)     | b    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Checker                 | s    | Read/Write | checker             |

   | Enabled (e)             | b    | Read/Write | N/A                 |
   | Expires (f)             | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Fingerprint             | s    | Read       | fingerprint         |
   | Host                    | s    | Read/Write | host                |
   | Interval (a)            | t    | Read/Write | interval            |
   | LastApprovalRequest (g) | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | LastCheckedOK (h)       | s    | Read/Write | N/A                 |
   | LastEnabled (i)         | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Name                    | s    | Read       | (Section name)      |
   | ObjectPath              | o    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Secret (j)              | ay   | Write      | secret (or secfile) |
   | Timeout (a)             | t    | Read/Write | timeout             |
   
   a) Represented as milliseconds.
   
   b) An approval is currently pending.
   
   c) Setting this property is equivalent to calling StartChecker() or
      StopChecker().
   
   d) The creation time of this client object, as an RFC 3339 string.
   
   e) Setting this property is equivalent to calling Enable() or
      Disable().
   
   f) The date and time this client will be disabled, as an RFC 3339
      string, or an empty string if this has not happened.
   
   g) The time of the last approval request, as an RFC 3339 string, or
      an empty string if this has not happened.
   
   h) The last time a checker was successful, as an RFC 3339 string,
      or an empty string if this has not happened.  Setting this
      property is equivalent to calling CheckedOK(), i.e. the current
      time is set, regardless of the string sent.  Please always use
      an empty string when setting this property, to allow for
      possible future expansion.
   
   i) The last time this client was enabled, as an RFC 3339 string, or
      an empty string if this has not happened.
   
   j) A raw byte array, not hexadecimal digits.

** Signals
*** CheckerCompleted(n: Exitcode, x: Waitstatus, s: Command)
    A checker (Command) has completed.  Exitcode is either the exit
    code or -1 for abnormal exit.  In any case, the full Waitstatus
    (as from wait(2)) is also available.
    
*** CheckerStarted(s: Command)
    A checker command (Command) has just been started.
    
*** GotSecret()
    This client has been sent its secret.
    
*** NeedApproval(t: Timeout, b: ApprovedByDefault)
    This client will be approved or denied in exactly Timeout
    milliseconds, depending on ApprovedByDefault.  Approve() can now
    usefully be called on this client object.
    
*** PropertyChanged(s: Property, v: Value)
    The Property on this client has changed to Value.
