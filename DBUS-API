		    Mandos Server D-Bus Interface

This file documents the D-Bus interface to the Mandos server.

* Bus: System bus
  Bus name: "se.recompile.Mandos"


* Object Paths:
  
  | Path                  | Object            |
  |-----------------------+-------------------|
  | "/"                   | The Mandos Server |
  | "/clients/CLIENTNAME" | Mandos Client     |

  
* Mandos Server Interface:
  Interface name: "se.recompile.Mandos"
  
** Methods:
*** GetAllClients() → (ao: Clients)
    Returns an array of all client D-Bus object paths
   
*** GetAllClientsWithProperties() → (a{oa{sv}}: ClientProperties)
    Returns an array of all clients and all their properties
   
*** RemoveClient(o: ObjectPath) → nothing
    Removes a client
   
** Signals:
*** ClientAdded(o: ObjectPath)
    A new client was added.
   
*** ClientNotFound(s: Fingerprint, s: Address)
    A client connected from Address using Fingerprint, but was
    rejected because it was not found in the server.  The fingerprint
    is represented as a string of hexadecimal digits.  The address is
    an IPv4 or IPv6 address in its normal string format.
   
*** ClientRemoved(o: ObjectPath, s: Name)
    A client named Name on ObjectPath was removed.


* Mandos Client Interface:
  Interface name: "se.recompile.Mandos.Client"
  
** Methods
*** Approve(b: Approve) → nothing
    Approve or deny a connected client waiting for approval.  If
    denied, a client will not be sent its secret.
    
*** CheckedOK() → nothing
    Assert that this client has been checked and found to be alive.
    This will restart the timeout before disabling this client.  See
    also the "LastCheckedOK" property.

** Properties
   
   Note: Many of these properties directly correspond to a setting in
   "clients.conf", in which case they are fully documented in
   mandos-clients.conf(5).
   
   | Name                    | Type | Access     | clients.conf        |
   |-------------------------+------+------------+---------------------|
   | ApprovedByDefault       | b    | Read/Write | approved_by_default |
   | ApprovalDelay (a)       | t    | Read/Write | approval_delay      |
   | ApprovalDuration (a)    | t    | Read/Write | approval_duration   |
   | ApprovalPending (b)     | b    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Checker                 | s    | Read/Write | checker             |
   | CheckerRunning (c)      | b    | Read/Write | N/A                 |
   | Created (d)             | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Enabled (e)             | b    | Read/Write | N/A                 |
   | Expires (f)             | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | ExtendedTimeout (a)     | t    | Read/Write | extended_timeout    |
   | Fingerprint             | s    | Read       | fingerprint         |
   | Host                    | s    | Read/Write | host                |
   | Interval (a)            | t    | Read/Write | interval            |
   | LastApprovalRequest (g) | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | LastCheckedOK (h)       | s    | Read/Write | N/A                 |
   | LastCheckerStatus (i)   | n    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | LastEnabled (j)         | s    | Read       | N/A                 |
   | Name                    | s    | Read       | (Section name)      |
   | Secret (k)              | ay   | Write      | secret (or secfile) |
   | Timeout (a)             | t    | Read/Write | timeout             |
   
   a) Represented as milliseconds.
   
   b) An approval is currently pending.
   
   c) Changing this property can either start a new checker or abort a
      running one.
   
   d) The creation time of this client object, as an RFC 3339 string.
   
   e) Changing this property enables or disables a client.
   
   f) The date and time this client will be disabled, as an RFC 3339
      string, or an empty string if this is not scheduled.
   
   g) The date and time of the last approval request, as an RFC 3339
      string, or an empty string if this has not happened.
   
   h) The date and time a checker was last successful, as an RFC 3339
      string, or an empty string if this has not happened.  Setting
      this property is equivalent to calling CheckedOK(), i.e. the
      current time is set, regardless of the string sent.  Please
      always use an empty string when setting this property, to allow
      for possible future expansion.
   
   i) The exit status of the last checker, -1 if it did not exit
      cleanly, -2 if a checker has not yet returned.
   
   j) The date and time this client was last enabled, as an RFC 3339
      string, or an empty string if this has not happened.
   
   k) A raw byte array, not hexadecimal digits.

** Signals
*** CheckerCompleted(n: Exitcode, x: Signal, s: Command)
    A checker (Command) has completed.  Exitcode is either the exit
    code or -1 for abnormal exit, in which case, the signal number
    is available.
    
*** CheckerStarted(s: Command)
    A checker command (Command) has just been started.
    
*** GotSecret()
    This client has been sent its secret.
    
*** NeedApproval(t: Timeout, b: ApprovedByDefault)
    This client will be approved or denied in exactly Timeout
    milliseconds, depending on ApprovedByDefault.  Approve() can now
    usefully be called on this client object.
    
*** Rejected(s: Reason)
    This client was not given its secret for a specified Reason.
