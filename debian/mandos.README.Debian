The Mandos server is useless without at least one configured client in
/etc/mandos/clients.conf.  To create one, install the "mandos-client"
package on a client computer, and, on the client, run the command

	# mandos-keygen --password

to get a config file stanza.  Append the output of that command to the
file "/etc/mandos/clients.conf" on the Mandos server computer.
