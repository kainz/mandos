_description: New client option "${key_id}" is REQUIRED on server
 A new "key_id" client option is REQUIRED in the server's clients.conf
 file, otherwise this computer most likely will not reboot unattended. 
 This option:
 .
  ${key_id}
 .
 must be added (all on one line!) on the Mandos server host, in the file
 /etc/mandos/clients.conf, right before the "fingerprint" option for this
 Mandos client.  You must edit that file on that server and add this
 option.
 .
 With GnuTLS 3.6.6, Mandos has been forced to stop using OpenPGP keys as
 TLS session keys.  A new TLS key pair has been generated and will be used
 as identification, but the key ID of the public key needs to be added to
 the server, since this will now be used to identify the client to the
 server.
