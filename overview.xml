  This is part of the Mandos system for allowing computers to have
  encrypted root file systems and at the same time be capable of
  remote and/or unattended reboots.  The computers run a small client
  program in the initial <acronym>RAM</acronym> disk environment which
  will communicate with a server over a network.  All network
  communication is encrypted using <acronym>TLS</acronym>.  The
  clients are identified by the server using an OpenPGP key; each
  client has one unique to it.  The server sends the clients an
  encrypted password.  The encrypted password is decrypted by the
  clients using the same OpenPGP key, and the password is then used to
  unlock the root file system, whereupon the computers can continue
  booting normally.
