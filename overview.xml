  This is part of the Mandos system for allowing computers to have
  encrypted root file systems and also be capable of remote and
  unattended reboots.  The computers run a small client program in the
  initial RAM disk environment which will communicate with a server
  over a network.  The clients are identified by the server using a
  OpenPGP key; each client has one unique to it.  The server sends the
  clients an encrypted password.  The encrypted password is decrypted
  by the clients using the same OpenPGP key, and the password is then
  used to unlock the root file system, whereupon the computers can
  continue booting normally.
