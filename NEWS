   clients.conf.

Version 1.0.2 (2008-10-17)
* mandos-keygen now signs the encrypted key blobs.  This signature is

* Server
** Expand environment variables and ~user in clients.conf's "secfile"

* Client (plugin-runner, plugins, etc.)
** Manual pages for the usplash, splashy, and askpass-fifo plugins.
   All plugins now have man pages.
** More secure compilation and linking flags.
   All programs are now compiled with "-fstack-protector-all -fPIE
   -pie", and linked using "-z relro -pie" for additional security.

* There is now a "NEWS" file (this one), giving a history of
  noteworthy changes.
