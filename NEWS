This NEWS file records noteworthy changes, very tersely.
See the manual for detailed information.

Version 1.5.2 (2012-01-08)
* Server
** Removed D-Bus signal se.recompile.Mandos.NewRequest() added in
   1.5.0.  It was buggy and was of questionable utility.

Version 1.5.1 (2012-01-01)
* Server
** Include intro(8mandos) manual page, missing since migration from
   README file in version 1.4.0.

Version 1.5.0 (2012-01-01)
* Client
** Network hooks.  The Mandos client can now run custom scripts to take
   up a network interface before the client is run.  Three example
   scripts are provided: "wireless", "openvpn", and "bridge".
   To facilitate this, the client now prefers network interfaces which
   are up (if any) over all other interfaces.
* Server
** Persistent state.  Client state is now saved between server
   restarts.
** clients.conf file can now contain "enabled" setting for clients.
** Bug fix: Fix rare crash bug.
** Bug fix: Send corrent D-Bus type in PropertyChanged for
   "ApprovalDelay", "ApprovalDuration", "Timeout", and
   "ExtendedTimeout".
** mandos-ctl: Bare numbers as arguments are taken to be milliseconds.
** Bug fix: mandos-ctl --secret option now works.
** New D-Bus signal: se.recompile.Mandos.NewRequest(s).

Version 1.4.1 (2011-10-15)
* Server
** Make D-Bus properties settable again, and handle checkers
   for disabled clients correctly.
* Miscellaneous fixes to "pedantic" Lintian warnings

Version 1.4.0 (2011-10-09)
* README file migrated to manual page intro(8mandos).
* Client:
** Fixed warning about "rmdir: Directory not empty".
* Server:
** Default values changed: timeout 5 minutes, interval 2 minutes.
** Clients gets an expiration extension when receiving a password,
   controlled by new "extended_timeout" setting.
** New domain name: "fukt.bsnet.se" changes to "recompile.se".  This
   also affects the D-Bus bus and interface names (old names still
   work).  Users should start using the new names immediately.
** New D-Bus Client object properties "Expires" and "ExtendedTimeout";
   see DBUS-API for details.

* Client:

   graphical boot system.
** The Mandos client now automatically chooses a network interface if
   the DEVICE setting in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf is set to
   the empty string.  This is also the new default instead of "eth0".
** The Mandos client --connect option now loops indefinitely until a
   password is received from the specified server.
** Bug fix: Quote directory correctly in mandos-keygen with --password
** Bug fix: don't use "echo -e" in mandos-keygen; unsupported by dash.
* Server:
** Terminology change: clients are now "ENABLED" or "DISABLED", not
   "valid" or "invalid".
** New D-Bus API; see the file "DBUS-API".
** New control utilities using the new D-Bus API:
   + mandos-ctl		       A command-line based utility
   + mandos-monitor	       A text-based GUI interface

* Client
** Bug fix: Allow network interface renaming by "udev" by taking down
   the network interface after using it.
** Bug fix: User-supplied plugins are now installed correctly.
** Bug fix: If usplash was used but the password was instead provided
   by the Mandos server, the usplash daemon used to ignore the first
   command passed to it.  This has been fixed.
** Bug fix: Make the "--userid" and "--groupid" options in
   "plugin-runner.conf" work.
* Server
** Bug fix: Fix the LSB header in the init.d script to make dependency
