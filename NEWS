   		  redirecting standard output.

   well as the $DEVICE environment variable for the network hooks) is
   now a comma-separated list of interfaces to use.

Version 1.5.5 (2012-06-01)

   up a network interface before the client is run.  Three example
   scripts are provided: "wireless", "openvpn", and "bridge".
   To facilitate this, the client now prefers network interfaces which
   are up (if any) over all other interfaces.
* Server
** Persistent state.  Client state is now saved between server
   restarts.
** clients.conf file can now contain "enabled" setting for clients.

** Clients gets an expiration extension when receiving a password,
   controlled by new "extended_timeout" setting.
** New domain name: "fukt.bsnet.se" changes to "recompile.se".  This
   also affects the D-Bus bus and interface names (old names still
   work).  Users should start using the new names immediately.

   see DBUS-API for details.

   graphical boot system.
** The Mandos client now automatically chooses a network interface if
   the DEVICE setting in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf is set to
   the empty string.  This is also the new default instead of "eth0".
** The Mandos client --connect option now loops indefinitely until a
   password is received from the specified server.
** Bug fix: Quote directory correctly in mandos-keygen with --password
** Bug fix: don't use "echo -e" in mandos-keygen; unsupported by dash.
* Server:
** Terminology change: clients are now "ENABLED" or "DISABLED", not
   "valid" or "invalid".
** New D-Bus API; see the file "DBUS-API".
** New control utilities using the new D-Bus API:

   "plugin-runner.conf" work.
* Server
** Bug fix: Fix the LSB header in the init.d script to make dependency
