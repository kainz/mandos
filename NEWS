** Start client checkers after a random delay
** When using systemd, allow easier modification of server options
** Better log messages in mandos-monitor
* Client
** When using dracut & systemd, allow easier modification of options

Version 1.8.9 (2019-09-03)
* No user-visible changes

Version 1.8.8 (2019-08-18)
* No user-visible changes

Version 1.8.7 (2019-08-05)
* Client:
** Always compile with LFS (Large File Support) enabled.
* Server
** Improve intro(8mandos) manual page to cover dracut(8) support.

Version 1.8.6 (2019-08-03)
* Client:
** dracut support: In password-agent, properly ignore deleted and
   renamed question files, and also fix memory alignment issue.

Version 1.8.5 (2019-07-30)
* Client
** Support dracut(8) as well as initramfs-tools(7).
** Minor bug fix: Allow the mandos-keygen --passfile option to use
   passfiles with names starting with "-".
** Document known limitation of mandos-keygen --password; it strips
   white space from start and end of the password.
* Server
** Bug fix: The server used to fail to restart if the "port" setting
   was used.  This has been fixed.
** Minor bug fix: Reap zombies left over from checker runs.  (Debian
   bug #933387)

Version 1.8.4 (2019-04-09)
* Client
** Fix minor memory leak in plugin-runner.
* Server
** mandos-ctl now has a --debug option to show D-Bus calls.

Version 1.8.3 (2019-02-11)
* No user-visible changes.

Version 1.8.2 (2019-02-10)
* Client
** In mandos-keygen, ignore failures to remove files in some cases.

Version 1.8.1 (2019-02-10)
* Client
** Only generate TLS keys using GnuTLS' certtool, of sufficient
   version.  Key generation of TLS keys will not happen until a
   version of GnuTLS is installed with support for raw public keys.
** Remove any bad keys created by 1.8.0 and openssl.
* Server
** On installation, edit clients.conf and remove the same bad key ID
   which was erroneously reported by all 1.8.0 clients.  Also do not
   trust this key ID in the server.

Version 1.8.0 (2019-02-10)
* Client
** Use new TLS keys for server communication and identification.
   With GnuTLS 3.6 or later, OpenPGP keys are no longer supported.
   The client can now use the new "raw public keys" (RFC 7250) API
   instead, using GnuTLS 3.6.6.  Please note: This *requires* new key
   IDs to be added to server's client.conf file.
** New --tls-privkey and --tls-pubkey options to load TLS key files.
   If GnuTLS is too old, these options do nothing.
* Server
** Supports either old or new GnuTLS.
   The server now supports using GnuTLS 3.6.6 and clients connecting
   with "raw public keys" as identification.  The server will read
   both fingerprints and key IDs from clients.conf file, and will use
   either one or the other, depending on what is supported by GnuTLS
   on the system.  Please note: both are *not* supported at once; if
   one type is supported by GnuTLS, all values of the other type from
   clients.conf are ignored.

Version 1.7.20 (2018-08-19)
* Client
** Fix: Adapt to the Debian cryptsetup package 2.0.3 or later.
   Important: in that version or later, the plugins "askpass-fifo",
   "password-prompt", and "plymouth" will no longer be run, since they
   would conflict with what cryptsetup is doing.  Other plugins, such
   as mandos-client and any user-supplied plugins, will still run.
** Better error message if failing to decrypt secret data
** Check for (and report) any key import failure from GPGME
** Better error message if self-signature verification fails
** Set system clock if not set; required by GnuPG for key import
** When debugging plugin-runner, it will now show starting plugins

Version 1.7.19 (2018-02-22)
* Client
** Do not print "unlink(...): No such file or directory".
** Bug fixes: Fix file descriptor leaks.
** Bug fix: Don't use leak sanitizer with leaking libraries.

   file for the currently recommended API.  Note: the original API
   still works, but is deprecated.
* Client
** Can now find Mandos server even if the server has an IPv6 address
   on a network without IPv6 Router Advertisment (like if the Mandos
   client itself is the router, or there is an IPv6 router advertising
   a network other than the one which the Mandos server is on.)
** Use a better value than 1024 for the default number of DH bits.
   This better value is either provided by a DH parameters file (see
   below) or an appropriate number of DH bits is determined based on
   the PGP key.
** Bug fix: mandos-keygen now generates correct output for the
   "Checker" variable even if the SSH server on the Mandos client has
   multiple SSH key types.
** Can now use pre-generated Diffie-Hellman parameters from a file.

Version 1.6.9 (2014-10-05)

Version 1.6.6 (2014-07-13)
* Client
** If client host has an SSH server, "mandos-keygen --password" now
   outputs "checker" option which uses "ssh-keyscan"; this is more
   secure than the default "fping" checker.

Version 1.6.2 (2013-10-24)
* Server
** PID file moved from /var/run to /run.

Version 1.6.0 (2012-06-18)
* Server
** Takes new --foreground option
** Init script supports new "status" action.
* Client
** Now uses all interfaces by default; the --interface option can

   up a network interface before the client is run.  Three example
   scripts are provided: "wireless", "openvpn", and "bridge".
   To facilitate this, the client now prefers network interfaces which
   are up (if any) over all other interfaces.
* Server
** Persistent state.  Client state is now saved between server
   restarts.
** clients.conf file can now contain "enabled" setting for clients.

** Clients gets an expiration extension when receiving a password,
   controlled by new "extended_timeout" setting.
** New domain name: "fukt.bsnet.se" changes to "recompile.se".  This
   also affects the D-Bus bus and interface names (old names still
   work).  Users should start using the new names immediately.
** New D-Bus Client object properties "Expires" and "ExtendedTimeout";
   see DBUS-API for details.

   is "R", not "r".

Version 1.2 (2010-09-28)
* Client:
** New "plymouth" plugin to ask for a password using the Plymouth
   graphical boot system.
** The Mandos client now automatically chooses a network interface if
   the DEVICE setting in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf is set to
   the empty string.  This is also the new default instead of "eth0".
** The Mandos client --connect option now loops indefinitely until a
   password is received from the specified server.
** Bug fix: Quote directory correctly in mandos-keygen with --password
** Bug fix: don't use "echo -e" in mandos-keygen; unsupported by dash.
* Server:
** Terminology change: clients are now "ENABLED" or "DISABLED", not
   "valid" or "invalid".
** New D-Bus API; see the file "DBUS-API".
** New control utilities using the new D-Bus API:
   + mandos-ctl		       A command-line based utility

   the network interface after using it.
** Bug fix: User-supplied plugins are now installed correctly.
** Bug fix: If usplash was used but the password was instead provided
   by the Mandos server, the usplash daemon used to ignore the first
   command passed to it.  This has been fixed.
** Bug fix: Make the "--userid" and "--groupid" options in
   "plugin-runner.conf" work.
* Server
** Bug fix: Fix the LSB header in the init.d script to make dependency
   based booting work.
