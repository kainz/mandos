* [#A] README file

* plugin-runner
** [#B] Add more comments to code
** [#B] Add more if(debug) calls
** [#B] Seperate more code to function for more readability

* password-request
** [#A] Man page: man8/password-request.8mandos
*** FILES
    Describe the key files and the key ring files.  Also note that
    they should normally have been automatically created.
*** BUGS
*** EXAMPLE
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, debugging by connecting
    directly, etc.
*** SECURITY
*** SEE ALSO
    Update from mandos.xml
** [#B] Temporarily lower kernel log level
   for less printouts during sucessfull boot.
** IPv4 support
** use strsep instead of strtok?
** Do not depend on GnuPG key rings on disk
   This would mean creating new GnuPG key rings with GPGME by
   importing the key files from scratch on every program start.
** Keydir move: /etc/mandos -> /etc/keys/mandos
   Must create in preinst if not pre-depending on cryptsetup

* password-prompt
** [#C] Use getpass(3)?
   Man page says "obsolete", but [[info:libc:getpass][GNU LibC Manual: Reading Passwords]]
   does not.  See also [[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2003-05/msg00251.html][Marcus Brinkmann: Re: getpass obsolete?]] and
   [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.glibc.alpha/4906][Petter Reinholdtsen: Re: getpass obsolete?]], and especially also
   [[http://www.steve.org.uk/Reference/Unix/faq_4.html#SEC48][Unix Programming FAQ 3.1 How can I make my program not echo input?]]

* mandos (server)
** [#A] /etc/init.d/mandos-server		:teddy:
** [#B] Log level				:bugs:
** /etc/mandos/clients.d/*.conf
   Watch this directory and add/remove/update clients?
** config for TXT record
** [#B] Run-time communication with server	:bugs:
   Probably using D-Bus
   See also [[*Mandos-tools]]
** Implement --foreground			:bugs:
   [[info:standards:Option%20Table][Table of Long Options]]
** Implement --socket
   [[info:standards:Option%20Table][Table of Long Options]]
** Date+time on console log messages		:bugs:
   Is this the default?

* Mandos-tools/utilities
  All of this probably using D-Bus
** List clients
** Disable client
** Enable client

* Man pages
** Use xinclude for common sections
   Like authors, etc.


* Installer
** Client-side
*** Update initrd.img after installation
    This seems to use some kind of "trigger" system
    [[file:/usr/share/doc/dpkg/triggers.txt.gz]]
    dpkg-trigger(1), deb-triggers(5)
*** Keydir move: /etc/mandos -> /etc/keys/mandos
    Must create in preinst if not pre-depending on cryptsetup
*** mandos-keygen
**** "--passfile" option
     Using the "secfile" option instead of "secret"
**** [#A] "--test" option
     For testing decryption before rebooting.
** Server-side
*** [#A] Create mandos user and group for server
*** [#A] Create /var/run/mandos directory with perm and ownership

* [#A] Package
** /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/mandos
*** Do not install in initrd.img if configured not to.
    Use "/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/mandos"?  Definitely a debconf
    question.
** /etc/bash_completion.d/mandos
   From XML sources directly?
** unperish
** bzr-builddeb
