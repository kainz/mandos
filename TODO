*** DESCRIPTION
    Describe the plus sign syntax for passing options from crypttab
*** EXIT STATUS
    Text needed
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, debugging single or all
    plugins, examples of crypttab lines with plus syntax, etc.

*** SEE ALSO
    Explaining test on what you can read
** Use asprintf instead of malloc and strcat?
** use strsep instead of strtok?
** use config file in addition to arguments
** pass things in environment, like device name, etc

* Password-request
** [#A] Man page: man8/password-request.8mandos
*** DESCRIPTION
    Move options to new OPTIONS section.
    State that this command is not meant to be invoked directly, but
    is run as a plugin from mandos-client(8) and only run in the
    initrd environment, not the real system.
*** EXIT STATUS
    Create this section
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, debugging by connecting
    directly, etc.
*** FILES
    Describe the key files and the key ring files.  Also note that
    they should normally have been automatically created.
*** DIAGNOSTICS
    Create this section
*** SECURITY
    Create this section
*** NOTES
    Create this section (if needed)
*** BUGS
    Create this section
*** SEE ALSO
    Refer to mandos-client(8mandos) and password-prompt(8mandos)
** Use asprintf instead of malloc and memcpy?
** IPv4 support
** use strsep instead of strtok?
** Do not depend on GPG key rings on disk
   This would mean creating new GPG key rings with GPGME by importing
   the key files from scratch on every program start.

* Password-prompt
** [#A] Man page: man8/password-prompt.8mandos
*** DESCRIPTION
    Move options to new OPTIONS section.
*** EXIT STATUS
    Create this section
*** EXAMPLES
    Examples of normal usage, debug usage, with a prefix, etc.
*** DIAGNOSTICS
    Create this section
*** SECURITY
    Create this section
    Not much to do here but it is noteworthy to state the danger of
    not having a fallback option.
*** NOTES
    Note that this is more or less a simple getpass(3) wrapper, even
    though actual use of getpass(3) is not guaranteed.
*** BUGS
    Create this section
*** SEE ALSO
    Refer to mandos-client(8mandos) and password-request(8mandos)
** Use getpass(3)?
   Man page says "obsolete", but [[info:libc:getpass][GNU LibC Manual: Reading Passwords]]
   does not.  See also [[http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2003-05/msg00251.html][Marcus Brinkmann: Re: getpass obsolete?]] and

** Replace completely with "/lib/cryptsetup/askpass"?
