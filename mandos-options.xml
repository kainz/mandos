  <title/>
  
  <para id="interface">
    If this is specified, the server will only announce the service
    and listen to requests on the specified network interface.
    Default is to use all available interfaces.  <emphasis
    >Note:</emphasis> a failure to bind to the specified
    interface is not considered critical, and the server will not
    exit, but instead continue normally.
  </para>
  
  <para id="address">
    If this option is used, the server will only listen to the
    specified IPv6 address.  If a link-local address is specified, an
    interface should be set, since a link-local address is only valid
    on a single interface.  By default, the server will listen to all
    available addresses.  If set, this must normally be an IPv6
    address; an IPv4 address can only be specified using IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 address syntax: <quote><systemitem class="ipaddress"
    >::FFFF:192.0.2.3</systemitem ></quote>.  (Only if IPv6 usage is
    <emphasis>disabled</emphasis> (see below) must this be an IPv4
    address.)
  </para>
  
  <para id="port">
    If this option is used, the server will bind to that port. By
    default, the server will listen to an arbitrary port given by the
    operating system.
  </para>
  
  <para id="debug">
    If the server is run in debug mode, it will run in the foreground
    and print a lot of debugging information.  The default is to
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> run in debug mode.
  </para>
  
  <para id="priority">
    GnuTLS priority string for the <acronym>TLS</acronym> handshake.
    The default is <quote><literal
    >SECURE256:!CTYPE-X.509:+CTYPE-OPENPGP</literal></quote>.  See
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gnutls_priority_init</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> for the syntax.
    <emphasis>Warning</emphasis>: changing this may make the
    <acronym>TLS</acronym> handshake fail, making server-client
    communication impossible.
  </para>
  
  <para id="servicename">
    Zeroconf service name.  The default is
    <quote><literal>Mandos</literal></quote>.  This only needs to be
    changed if for some reason is would be necessary to run more than
    one server on the same <emphasis>host</emphasis>.  This would not
    normally be useful.  If there are name collisions on the same
    <emphasis>network</emphasis>, the newer server will automatically
    rename itself to <quote><literal>Mandos #2</literal></quote>, and
    so on; therefore, this option is not needed in that case.
  </para>
  
  <para id="dbus">
    This option controls whether the server will provide a D-Bus
    system bus interface.  The default is to provide such an
    interface.
  </para>
  
  <para id="ipv6">
    This option controls whether the server will use IPv6 sockets and
    addresses.  The default is to use IPv6.  This option should
    <emphasis>never</emphasis> normally be turned off, <emphasis>even in
    IPv4-only environments</emphasis>.  This is because <citerefentry>
    <refentrytitle>mandos-client</refentrytitle>
    <manvolnum>8mandos</manvolnum></citerefentry> will normally use
    IPv6 link-local addresses, and will not be able to find or connect
    to the server if this option is turned off.  <emphasis>Only
    advanced users should consider changing this option</emphasis>.
  </para>
  
  <para id="restore">
    This option controls whether the server will restore its state
    from the last time it ran.  Default is to restore last state.
  </para>
  
  <para id="statedir">
    Directory to save (and restore) state in.  Default is
    <quote><filename
    class="directory">/var/lib/mandos</filename></quote>.
  </para>
  
  <para id="socket">
    If this option is used, the server will not create a new network
    socket, but will instead use the supplied file descriptor.  By
    default, the server will create a new network socket.
  </para>
